Within the following folder "WM-2 Smart Grasping" you will find 16 files that are all required to run the code.

On top of the 16 files you will need to install the following toolboxes on Matlab to run the code:

Robotics System Toolbox - https://www.mathworks.com/help/robotics/index.html
Model Predictive Control Toolbox - https://www.mathworks.com/help/mpc/index.html
Optimization Toolbox - https://www.mathworks.com/help/optim/index.html
Stateflow - https://www.mathworks.com/help/stateflow/index.html

*The attached links will take you to the documentation for the toolboxes, not the download page*

Inside the folder you can also find a file named "SetUp". This file does not need to be downloaded, or
installed. This text file has the command you must run after installing the program to make the program
begin its execution. The entire block of commands can be directly copied and pasted in the console.
